<p>hello https://twitter.com/TheFilmStage/status/896903098060349440</p>
<p>The footage of Bowie was taken from his role in the 1992 Twin Peaks prequel movie, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me. Bowie played FBI agent Phillip Jeffries in the show.</p>
<p>Previously, Harry Goaz, an actor on the show, revealed in an interview that David Bowie, who had a small role in the 1992 film spin off Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, was set to return to make a cameo, but it didn’t happen before the musician’s death last year.</p>
<p>Lynch nevertheless included him in the latest episode, using Fire Walk With Me footage in a dream sequence.</p>
<p>The appearance puts Bowie in the company of numerous other musical guest stars in the current series, including Moby, Nine Inch Nails, Sky Ferreira and Hudson Mohawke.</p>
<p>Fans were delighted and emotional about the reunion.</p>
